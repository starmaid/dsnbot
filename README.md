## Contribution

If you are a member of the server reading this and youre saying "hey i want to help!" then
just DM me (starmaid) with your github username or email and I can add you as a collaborator! 
Once theres more than just me on this project, ill protect the main branch - you will have to be familiar with github if you arent already, so keep that in mind (not difficult, but will take a minute. definitely worth it though).

If you dont want to code but see an issue or have a suggestion, feel free to open an issue for 
bug tracking :) or of course we can talk in #programming
