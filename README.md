## contribution

If you are a member of the server reading this and youre saying "hey i want to help!" then
just DM me (starmaid) with your github username or email and I can add you as a collaborator! 
We will use good practice of branching first and then using pull requests to merge with master,
so keep that in mind.

If you dont want to code but see an issue or have a suggestion, feel free to open an issue for 
bug tracking :) or of course we can talk in control-panel
